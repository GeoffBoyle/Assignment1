  <h2><p><b><u>About Me</u></b></p></h2>
 <br>I'm a 43year old Australian that speaks English and a little bit of Indonesian.</br>
 <br>I am married and have a 3 month old child.</br>
 <br>My interests and hobbies are travelling, watching movies, rugby league, fishing and working with computers.</br>
 <br>I completed year 12 back in 1995, followed by studying PC Support and Web Development.</br>
<h2><p><b><u>My Interest in IT</u></b></p></h2>
<img src="ram.jpg" align="right" style="width:200px;height:200px;padding-left:20px;"/>

   I am currently undecided at the moment which career pathway I will choose in IT.</br>
   <br>My interest in IT started back at high school, I enjoyed the subject from day one.</br>
   <br>Some of the tasks involved were using MSDOS, SQL, Windows and understanding the basics of computer fundamentals.</br>
<h2><p><b><u>My IT Experiences</u></b></p></h2>
   <br>At home, I would disassemble computers to understand all of the components and how they work.</br>
   <br>Experiment with operating systems and creating batch files though MSDOS.</br>
   <br>I learnt from studying web development to use software such as Dream weaver, Flash, Fireworks, html and Javascript.</br>
   <br>That was approximately 20 years ago. Since then, my memory has become faint and some of the software would be out of date.</br>
<h2><p><b><u>My choice to come to RMIT</u></b></p></h2>
   <br>I had contacted a lot of university campuses for information about studying a Bachelor of Information Technology.</br>
   <br>From my research, I had discovered not all campuses offer 100% online study.</br>
   <br>The degree structure and subjects on offer with RMIT cover a broad range of areas in IT that are of interest.</br>
   <br>I expect to learn real life skills from industry experts that cover a variety of areas in IT.</br>
   <br>Another expectation of learning is to work in teams effectively, efficiently and professionally.</br>

<br>The results in the test show some of the characteristics about myself. I believe this can be helpful when it</br>
<br>comes to looking for some characteristics of the other people in the group.</br>
<br>As a team member, it can be useful when having to deal with issues and resolving conflict within the group. </br>
<br>From the employerâ€™s perspective, they might be looking for specific people with a particular mindset to achieve acertain result.</br>
<br>When it comes to how the results may influence behaviour in a team, somebody that is highly motivated may find it</br>
<br>difficult to work with somebody else that does not have much motivation. There might be other specific characteristics</br>
<br>that can make some people more difficult to work with than others.</br>
<br>When forming a team, you need to take in account the type of people that have specific characteristics that you</br> 
<br>can work with, rather than people that you might find difficult and may have conflict with.</br>
