   <h4><p>About Me</p></h4>
 <p>I'm a 43year old australian that speaks english and a little bit of indonesian.</p>
 <p>I am married with one 3 month old child.
 <p>My interests and hobbies are travelling, watching movies, rugby league, fishing and working with computers.</p>
 <p>I completed year 12 back in 1995, followed by studying pc support and web development.</p>
  
   <h4><p>My Interest in IT</p></h4>
   <p>I am currently undecided at the moment which career pathway I will choose in IT.</p>
   <p>My interest in IT started back at high school, I enjoyed the subject from day one.</p>
   <p>Some of the tasks involved were using MSDOS, SQL, Windows and understanding the basics of computer fundamentals.</p>
   <h4><p>My IT Experiences</p></h4>
   <p>At home, I would disassemble computers to understand all of the components and how they work.</p>
   <p>Experiment with operating systems and creating batch files though MSDOS.</p>
   <p>I learnt from studying web development to use software such as dream weaver, flash, fireworks, html and javascript.</p>
   <p>That was approximately 20 years ago. Since then, my memory has become faint and some of the software would be out dated.</p>
