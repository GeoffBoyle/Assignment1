   <h4><p>About Me</p></h4>
 <p>I'm a 43year old Australian that speaks english and a little bit of Indonesian.</p>
 <p>I am married with one 3 month old child.
 <p>My interests and hobbies are travelling, watching movies, rugby league, fishing and working with computers.</p>
 <p>I completed year 12 back in 1995, followed by studying PC Support and Web Development.</p>
  <h4><p>My Interest in IT</p></h4>
   <p>I am currently undecided at the moment which career pathway I will choose in IT.</p>
   <p>My interest in IT started back at high school, I enjoyed the subject from day one.</p>
   <p>Some of the tasks involved were using MSDOS, SQL, Windows and understanding the basics of computer fundamentals.</p>
   <h4><p>My IT Experiences</p></h4>
   <p>At home, I would disassemble computers to understand all of the components and how they work.</p>
   <p>Experiment with operating systems and creating batch files though MSDOS.</p>
   <p>I learnt from studying web development to use software such as Dream weaver, Flash, Fireworks, html and Javascript.</p>
   <p>That was approximately 20 years ago. Since then, my memory has become faint and some of the software would be out dated.</p>
   <h4><p>My choice to come to RMIT</p></h4>
   <p>I had contacted a lot of university campuses for information about studying a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
   <p>From my research, I had discovered not all campuses offer 100% online study.</p>
   <p>The degree structure and subjects on offer with RMIT cover a broad range of areas in IT that are of interest.</p>
   <p>I expect to learn real life skills from industry experts that cover a variety of areas in IT.</p>
   <p>Another expectation of learning is to work in teams effectively, efficiently and professionally.</p>
