  <p><h2><b><u><center>Project Idea</center></u></b></h2></p>
 <p><h4>Overview</h4></p>
<br>The project idea is about creating vehicle inspection software that can be used on a tablet for the mechanics 
to use while performing an inspection on a vehicle, this will be in a form format which is linked to a database.
The purpose is to link a parts inventory list relating to the specific car with the parts that need to be replaced, 
listed on the inspection form. The mechanic inputs the parts on the form to be replaced, the software calculates
a quote for the parts and displays the stock levels from the supplier that are required for the job. At the end of the quote, 
the program has the option to go ahead and place the order for the parts required to start the job. A final invoice can
also be generated for the goods and services supplied.</br>
    <p><h4>Motivation</p></h4>
 <br>There are so many mechanic businesses throughout the world have so much work to do daily. Looking for an 
 effective way to save on time and to increase productivity. After a mechanic inspects a vehicle and assesses 
 which parts are required to be replaced, The next step is to check the price and availability of the parts for 
 the job to be complete, followed by advising the customer, which can be time consuming. Due to having a high 
 volume of customers and meeting their demands, there is a high importance to look for a system that is effective
 to save time and meet customer deadlines more efficiently. Many customers rely on their vehicles, they are a 
necessity to complete tasks daily.</br>
<p><h4>Description</h4></p>
<br>A digital vehicle inspection software that is designed to be compatible with a parts inventory list. The 
inventory list will display the part required, price and the quantity available. The details on the inspection 
form requires the vehicle make, model and year. This also requires the work that needs to be carried out on the 
vehicle and the list of parts that need to be replaced to complete the job. In the design, it is required to 
generate a quote at the end of the vehicle inspection form. The inspection form will need to be linked to a 
stock inventory list. This list is linked from the supplier. This will display the stock quantities available, 
cost price and the recommended retail price from the supplier. The user of the software (mechanic) will get to 
see all this data however at the end of the form, there will be an option to generate a quote or the option to 
create an invoice. The quote information will display the following fields, the details of the car, the parts 
that need to be replaced and any additional work that needs to be carried out. The total cost for the labour 
and recommended retail price for the parts will be generated at the end of the quote. The difference between 
the invoice and quote is, the quote displays the details of the parts and services recommended, the invoice 
displays the parts and services supplied.
The report with the quote is then stored, so it can be retrieved when required.
If the customer is happy to go ahead with the job, the order for the parts can be placed instantly at a click of
a button. (Having a proceed option at the bottom of the quote).
Each user will require a login, however the information entered on the form can be accessed and retrieved by 
other users if required.
I believe that the project would be interesting as there are so many processes involved with bringing the whole 
package together. There are also multiple skills required to develop this project.
There were many factors that had to be considered with the creation of the project. I had to consider the 
obstacles and setbacks that may be encountered.
How often the software would need to be upgraded? This would need to be updated on a regular basis due to 
new makes and models of vehicles entering the market. 
Having a back-up plan if the main supplier was out of stock. (This would require having more than one supplier available for the same product). 
How the existing data would be stored and what back-up devices are being used?   (Cloud Storage)
Cost factors to implement the new software.
Existing hardware:
Is it already sufficient?
Does it need upgrading or replacing?
Timeframe to have the project complete.
</br>
<p><h4>Tools and Technologies</p></h4>
<br>The user will be able to use the software on a Tablet or PC.
A server would also need to be required.  
At first, I would require software that can be used that is suitable for the different types of hardware 
required. The types of hardware that would be used are items such as an Apple iPad, Mac, Android Tablets and 
Windows based platforms. Compatibility is important as there are a variety of branches in the business that 
would have different hardware preferences as well as the hardware currently set up. Other software required 
for the vehicle inspection will need to be in a database format that can be utilised to carry out the tasks 
required.
</br>
<p><h4>Skills Required</h4></p>
<br>A virtual server can be created using software such as VMware. 
 This will allow multiple operating systems and a variety of hardware to be compatible to the vehicle 
 inspection software, this will also allow the sharing of data across the network. Having the network set up 
 will allow you to work onsite or from a remote location. Creating a multiple number of virtual machines will 
 also allow the business to continue using the software with minimal downtime.
Additional software will need to be written to create a database for the vehicle inspection software. 
The database software will require numerous fields that relate to the vehicles details.
This software will need to be linked to the supplier database that can display stock quantities, 
recommended retail price and the cost price for the part.
</br>
<p><h4>Outcome</h4></p>
<br>If the project is successful, the original problem that relates to saving time and to increase productivity 
 will be solved. This development would become of great benefit. This will give the ability to work onsite 
 or remotely (as a mobile mechanic), as well as achieving the result at the same time. Providing that, the 
 supplierâ€™s quantities are always up to date, this will take away the extra work for the mechanic, having to 
 hunt for the price and availability of the parts required and also generating a quote for the customer at the 
 same time. This will allow more time for the mechanic to meet tighter deadlines and concentrate on areas that
 are of up most importance.
