  <p><h2><b><u><center>Project Idea</center></u></b></h2></p>
 <p><h4>Overview</h4></p>
<p>
<br>The project idea is about creating vehicle inspection software that can be used on a tablet for the mechanics 
to use while performing an inspection on a vehicle, this will be in a form format which is linked to a database.
The purpose is to link a parts inventory list relating to the specific car with the parts that need to be replaced, 
listed on the inspection form. The mechanic inputs the parts on the form to be replaced, the software calculates
a quote for the parts and displays the stock levels from the supplier that are required for the job. At the end of the quote, 
the program has the option to go ahead and place the order for the parts required to start the job. A final invoice can
also be generated for the goods and services supplied.</br>
    <p><h4>Motivation</p></h4>
</p>
<p>
 <br>There are so many mechanic businesses throughout the world have so much work to do daily. Looking for an 
 effective way to save on time and to increase productivity. After a mechanic inspects a vehicle and assesses 
 which parts are required to be replaced, The next step is to check the price and availability of the parts for 
 the job to be complete, followed by advising the customer, which can be time consuming. Due to having a high 
 volume of customers and meeting their demands, there is a high importance to look for a system that is effective
 to save time and meet customer deadlines more efficiently. Many customers rely on their vehicles, they are a 
 necessity to complete tasks daily.</br>
