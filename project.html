  <p><h2><b><u><center>Project Idea</center></u></b></h2></p>
 <p><h4>Overview</h4></p>
<br>The project idea is about creating vehicle inspection software that can be used on a tablet for the mechanics</br> 
<br>to use while performing an inspection on a vehicle, this will be in a form format which is linked to a database.</br> 
<br>The purpose is to link a parts inventory list relating to the specific car with the parts that need to be replaced,</br> 
<br>listed on the inspection form. The mechanic inputs the parts on the form to be replaced, the software calculates</br> 
<br>a quote for the parts and displays the stock levels from the supplier that are required for the job. At the end of the quote,</br> 
<br>the program has the option to go ahead and place the order for the parts required to start the job. A final invoice can</br>
<br>also be generated for the goods and services supplied.</br>
